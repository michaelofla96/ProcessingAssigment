# ProcessingAssigment
After reading the spec for this assignment, I took a few days brainstorming on what I would do it on. The examples given in the spec were all from sci-fi movies. I hadn't seen much sci-fi movies so I thought maybe it was time to do some light study on them. I watched a few movies and look at the warp drive, engines and communications systems. All of them seemed so technical and so advanced, how could I code anything like that. None of the systems gave me inspiration to start coding. I started thinking about video games I had played that had these sci fi systems. After looking through a few old games, I decided to do my project on an old game of mine Metal Gear Solid. In the game the character spy ‘Snake’ uses a communications system called Codec to communicate. Snake is constantly behind enemy lines. He uses this communications system to get his next mission and relay information. I had decided to code this system for my Processing Assignment.
I started with the layout of the assignment, since there is many Metal Gear games the Communications system Codec varies from game to game. There are slight changes each year but it mainly looks the same. I picked the layout I was going to do and start coding it. The spacing of this project was difficult to pick up on at the start. I was drawing the rectangles but just couldn’t space them evenly across the screen. One side would look squashed and then it would happen to the other. Maybe this was because there wasn’t much on the screen at the start but it was a task to space everything out. I left extra space because I knew there would be extra things I wanted to add as I moved through the project. So, I drew out my rectangles and ellipses. I thought they looked a bit plain on the screen so I started to add some lines between the shapes. Getting the co-ordinates for these lines was a lot harder than I thought at first, it also messed with the spacing because I wanted to leave the same gap between shape and line on both sides. After I got this worked out I agreed to not change the layout of the assignment again only if there was an emergency.
After the layout, my next job was to pick the colours. In the Metal Gear games the communications is usually the colour black. I thought putting the whole, assignment black would be boring. The assignment needs to jump out at the person using it so I decided against black and went for a dark green. I also changed the font of the project to do that I had to go into tolls and create font. I tried to have a few different fonts in the project. But every time I tried to load two fonts and call them the project crashed. This is one of the tasks I never got around so I have just the one font for the whole project.
After this I loaded the images into my project. The images had to be edited in paint to fit the rectangle I had drawn for them. Some of the images were not long enough for the rectangle and if I stretched them out any more they would look distorted. So, I out their information underneath the images and it appeared when you hovered over it with the mouse. I used the tune button which when pressed let you go to the next image as if you were on a communication system switching chat. After it clicked through the image the project was kind of obsolete. I had it run so when the button was pressed it jumped back to the first image. But then I added the static which like a real communications system is on when the radio is not in tune. The project flicks between the three images and then back to the static. I then added a static sound which plays when the project is first opened. I tried to code it so the static plays anytime the static comes on screen but it didn’t work the way I wanted it to.
Lastly, I created a calling screen that would show up first as if a call was being made like in the game. The screen has the has the ringing sound from Metal Gear. I also added the alert sound for when the tune button is clicked and a static sound for when the static is on. This assignment was the enjoyable assignment since I started college. It gave the student loads of freedom and room for creativity.
